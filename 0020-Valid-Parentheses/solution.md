ðŸ“„ Valid Parentheses Problem â€” C++ Solution
Problem Statement

You are given a string s containing only the characters:

'(' , ')' , '{' , '}' , '[' , ']'

You need to determine if the string is valid.

A string is valid if:

Open brackets are closed by the same type of bracket.

Open brackets are closed in the correct order.

Every closing bracket has a corresponding opening bracket.

Examples
Input	Output	Explanation
"()"	true	A simple pair of brackets.
"()[]{}"	true	Multiple valid pairs.
"(]"	false	Wrong type of closing bracket.
"([])"	true	Nested valid brackets.
"([)]"	false	Wrong order of closing.
Approach: Using Stack
Key Idea

We need to check brackets in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order:

The last opened bracket should be the first one to close.

A stack is the perfect data structure for this.

Steps

Create an empty stack of characters.

Traverse the string s character by character:

If the character is an opening bracket ((, {, [), push it onto the stack.

If the character is a closing bracket (), }, ]):

Check if the stack is empty â†’ return false (no matching opening bracket).

Otherwise, pop the top element and check if it matches the type of the closing bracket.

If it doesnâ€™t match â†’ return false.

After processing all characters:

If the stack is empty â†’ all brackets matched correctly â†’ return true.

Otherwise â†’ return false.

C++ Implementation
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool isValid(string s) {
    stack<char> st;
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '(' || c == '{' || c == '[') {
            st.push(c);
        } else {
            if (st.empty()) return false;
            char top = st.top();
            st.pop();
            if ((c == ')' && top != '(') ||
                (c == '}' && top != '{') ||
                (c == ']' && top != '[')) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return st.empty();
}

int main() {
    cout << boolalpha; // prints true/false instead of 1/0
    cout << isValid("()") << endl;       // true
    cout << isValid("()[]{}") << endl;   // true
    cout << isValid("(]") << endl;       // false
    cout << isValid("([])") << endl;     // true
    cout << isValid("([)]") << endl;     // false
}

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n)

Each character is processed once.

Stack operations (push/pop) take constant time.

Space Complexity: O(n)

In the worst case, all characters are opening brackets, stored in the stack.

Advantages of Stack Approach

âœ” Simple and efficient.
âœ” Naturally handles nested brackets.
âœ” Works for any combination of brackets.
